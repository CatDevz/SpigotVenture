# SpigotVenture
'SpigotVenture' is a clone of Mr. Crayfishes mod Venture designed to run on Spigot servers instead of a client side mod. Mr Crayfishes Venture mod can be found on his website at https://mrcrayfish.com/mods?id=venture 

### Libraries Used
SpigotVenture uses a single library titled "StructureBlockLib", this allows me to use minecraft's default structure format, allowing you to easily replace the structures placed by the plugin, I plan on in the future modifying this library and compiling it into my plugin as to not require any other plugins to be installed on the server
